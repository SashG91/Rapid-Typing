## Project Overview
Welcome to Rapid Typing a simple typing game that encourages and challenges users to practice and improve their typing efficiency. The Rapid Typing Game was designed to help new and returning users to improve their typing proficiency.

The goal for this project was to combine my understanding of html, CSS and JavaScript to create an easy to use site that allows the user to challenge and improve their typing efficiency.

## User Stories

### New visitor

### Returning visitor
- I want to challenge my previous high score.
- I want to practice typing new words.

## User Profiles
### Andrew

### Serena
- Is a software developer who has a significant amount of typing practice, she would like to be faster and try typing words as quick as she can.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
* The project is aimed at providing a convenient and simple way for users to imporve their typing efficiency for both beginner to experienced.

* It is aimed at targetting users who would just like to try a short game or someone who would like to improve their typing speed.

* The site will also be updated on a monthly basis to offer new words.

### Design Choices
* The site was designed to create a sense of competition to try encourage users to improve their typing speed and type as many words as possible without running out of time.


#### Colors
* The color palette for the site was inspired by using the Coolors.co website. The choice was based on using colours that compliment each other in a way that does not distract the user. The colors are consistent throught the game (including the 404 Error page). The exact colors used can be seen in the image below.
![Color Pallete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97494070/167850825-f08f7ef9-f4ab-404f-b920-7ed8f1350b09.png)


#### Typography
* The website contains two primary font types 'Bebas Neue' for the header and headings which was then paired with the body text of Roboto using Google Fonts. Here is a [link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) which was used to compare and determine which fonts would compliment each other best for this sort of site. The inclusion of 'sans-serif' was applied as a fall-back font.

#### Icons
* Icons were used to give the site more character and keep within the game theme. The keyboard icon associated with the header is the central icon and was made consistent across all pages with the header. Hover effects were applied to allsocial icons to give the user more awareness. 

### Wireframes
Initial designs for the site were created using Balsamiq, the completed project is very closely designed to match the wireframes provided below for mobile, table and desktop. Some adjustments were made to the location of text, buttons and sections when compared to the completed project.

## Website Structure
The website was originally designed to be a simple easy to follow platform. The site follows a simple structure and consists of 1 main page that shows the game instructions and game play area, this is then supported by a level page that allows the user to select their level. It was initially designed for mobile use with responsiveness being applied to account for both tablet and desktop usage. No compromise was made in terms of sharing the same experience across all devices. User interest and comfort was carried through the entire site, the use of hover effects on buttons to ensure ease of use at any point on the site.

## Features

##### Footer
- The footer is consistent across the entire site and contains the social links related to the TCM initiative.
- The links have been created so that the user is taken to a new tab once clicked so as to prevent them from leaving the main page.
- The footer is aimed to encourage users on social media in hopes of generating more attraction to Rapid Typing.

##### Error 404 page
- The Error 404 page was designed to warn the user that something has gone wrong. The user can then click the heading or tabs to go back to safety.
- The header and footer is consistent on this page to give the user comfort that safety is only a click away.
- An image consistent with the site and bold red text was used to make it more personal.
